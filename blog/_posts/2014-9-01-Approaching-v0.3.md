title: Approaching v0.3
---

Version 0.3 marks a point for Melatonin where I am satisfied
with its functionality and unable to immediately improve upon
it. Notably, the extension has:
- automatic sun-based color/temperature progression
- a responsive and interactive interface
- a customizable configuration
Problems, such as the delay before the overlay, beg for
solutions, but they are not currently obvious to me. When they
are, I will try to incorporate them. For this to happen, I think
there will have to be some advancements in Chrome Apps or Chrome
itself. (see Technical Difficulties on ChromeOS)

I'm putting a lot of thought into the interface of Melatonin, as
I am trying to finalize it. It's gone from just a single slider,
to a slider and an on/off toggle, to adding the option for
custom color, and then to this: (image,

Yet, now as I am nearing a final decision, I think the
simplicity of a single slider beats the clutter of the
alternatives.
