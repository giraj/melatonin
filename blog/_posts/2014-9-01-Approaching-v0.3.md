title: Approaching v0.3

Version 0.3 marks a point for Melatonin where I am satisfied
with its functionality and unable to immediately improve upon
it. Notably, the extension is:
	- automatic and in tune with the sun
	- responsive and interactive (real-time changes)
	- customizable
There are still problems ([see Technical Difficulties on ChromeOS)]({{ site.baseurl }}/Technical-ChromeOS/)), and I'll solve them when I can. For the time being, their solutions aren't technically obvious.

I'm putting a lot of thought into the interface of Melatonin, as
I am trying to finalize it. It's gone from just a single slider,
to a slider and an on/off toggle, to adding the option for
custom color, and then to this:

Yet, now as I am nearing a final decision, I think the
simplicity of a single slider beats the clutter of the
predecessors.
