            <h3>Melatonin released!</h3>
            <span class='subtitle'>published 2014.07.16</span>

            <p> Actually, I decided to publish Melatonin to the
            chrome store in the beginning of june. Since then,
            I've published 4 new updates; most notably v0.2.4 -
            the most recent - which improves the algorithm for
            the altitude calculations used by Melatonin.  </p>

            <p> I created Melatonin for my own use, having found
            the alternatives for Chrome OS unsatisfying in terms
            of usability (responsive interface) and features
            (automatic color). F.lux has sane defaults and good
            automation, I wanted these things for Melatonin
            coupled with a minimalistic interface.</p>

            <p>Currently, that interface is perhaps too
            minimalistic; sacrificing power for simplicity. In
            update v0.3.0 I hope to have constructed a better
            comprimise between the two.</p>
