ALTITUDE
Currently, get_sun_altitude seems to return good values until
around ~15h, where it decreases too quickly, giving a sunset
around 18h for Belgium (50, 3). A more realistic result would be
around 21h. I've verified the function get_sun_altitude itself
according to the pages (wikipedia) in the comments, also I've
verified the helper funcitons. Maybe the problem lies in
calculation of julian dates, but I remember getting sane results
there also.

I'm making a workaround in the linear color calculations, mapping 
2700k to -15 deg (not 0 deg), and 6300k to 90 deg (as usual) in
hope of acheiving more natural results. -15 deg seems to
correspond better to the actual sunset.

TRANSITIONS
Had some bugs quickly toggling transitions, the changes wouldn't
transition properly. Got the idea to set transition on
browser_action open, and reset onDisconnected using the
port-hack. Will maybe implement later.
